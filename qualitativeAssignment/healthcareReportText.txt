The complaint focused on the ineffectiveness of (free) health services, citing problems such as poor diagnosis, lack of treatment, and failure to cover the costs of treating certain health conditions.  The treatment journey is a tiring one. Most people do not follow up or return for treatment, because of the bad first experience.  Poor economic situation is the biggest challenge faced by families, and a major obstacle to receiving excellent service in the private sector.  Lack of credibility in dealing, nepotism and favoritism, carelessness by employees, financial exploitation (transportation / taxi).  Focus on the weakness of free health services and inaccurate diagnosis.  Poor financial conditions are a major obstacle to receiving better service and securing treatment.  We need medical security, because we are afraid aid might be cut off just like the case with Jordan Health Aid Society.  We receive the services from the Emirati hospital and other places.  They suffer from long waiting times because of the pressure on the Emirati Hospital.  The group agreed that the Emirati Hospital provides good service.  One of the women is a beneficiary of Amal Association.  They felt comfortable after talking about their suffering and talking to people who would listen.  Emphasis was placed on care provided by UNHCR centers or free centers, due to the presence of large number of children.  They do not follow any self-care system or use alternative medicine before going to the doctor.  The type of care received focused on medical care from: private clinics, Emirates Hospital, a university health center.  The types of care were limited to clinics and hospitals, self-care, and consultations with pharmacists.              Drink plenty of water to keep your body clean from the inside.  Stay away from ready-made food and canned foods.  Secure adequate and good accommodation with good temperature levels in the summer and winter.  Drink herbs all the time.  Wake up early.  Drink hot water in the morning.  Drink herbs constantly.  Reduce the meals.  Informal care, private clinic, pharmacies.  They visit a doctor to obtain treatment and diagnosis.  Mobility is a burden with more than one child.  The presence of a number of children makes them always vulnerable to emergencies, so there is always a visit to health care centers.  They depend on asking relatives and friends and the experience of others in knowing centers and services.  In the event that a free service is available in another governorate, they can handle the burden and transportation costs if the service was good.  Not receiving treatment without a doctor diagnosis.  Not relying on an herbal-based medication system or alternative medicine.  Conducting all tests or follow-up medical treatment necessary even if he had to incur the full costs of the treatment and diagnosis and was unable to find an entity to provide free treatment or financial support covering the costs of treatment.  His battle with chronic diseases:  He is interested in centers that provide periodic care and follow-up, and is keen to get periodic treatment monthly.  Most of the places of medical service providers are confined to Irbid, his city of residence.   However, he does not mind incurring the costs and burden of moving to another governorate for medical treatment if it is free, and if the service is excellent.   However, if the service is not free or requires a small fee, he prefers to go to a private clinic in the same area, and save effort and the cost of transportation.  As for his experience in receiving treatment, his evaluation of the experience varies depending on where he received the treatment.   The table below - (Classification of beneficiaries of health resources) contains his evaluation of every service based on location.  Relying on self-care if one of their children is exposed to certain symptoms, and that they do not resort to the doctor immediately (they use herbs, pain killers and children's hypothermia drugs are always available at home).   At other times, they depend on the pharmacist’s diagnosis in order to prescribe medications without a doctor.  Depending on people networks for information.  They are totally unable to go to another governorate to receive treatment even if the service was free of charge, because they have children who cannot be left at home or be taken on a treatment trip that might last a full day.   They prefer going to a private doctor and bearing the costs of treatment, thus saving time, effort, and travel costs.    Feeling of pain in the lower back. Increasing pain drove her to go to the Emirati Hospital She inquired, and through friends and acquaintances, was able to A psychological condition that led to.    With severe abdominal pain, she was new in the area and she relied on painkillers/herbs, which were very costly.   After the pain persisted for 3 months, she decided to visit the Emirati Hospital.    The brother suffered from severe pain in his stomach, abdomen, and digestive system.   They did an ECHO scan at the Emirati Hospital. He took some painkillers, but after the pain increased, they were instructed to hospitalize him through Jordan Health Aid Society, but since they live outside the camp, they were not covered.   So they were transferred to Mafraq Governmental Hospital, which, in turn, transferred them to Zarqa.    When we are in a very critical health situation, the first thing we can think of is where to go? Who will help us? Are there organizations close by, so we do not have endure troubles in transportation?  If we have difficulty dealing with the health situation, we have to go to private and expensive clinics.    I have children in their thirties who are helping me get medical care, book appointments, even follow up my treatment, but unfortunately they will be leaving the country and I do not know what to do with my health.   I suffer from hypertension and diabetes.   I also hear about the bad treatment some people receive.    When they decided to go to government centers or private clinics, some of the women were showing symptoms, like headache, dizziness, general weakness, and other symptoms of multiple communicable and non-communicable diseases.  Some of them had a chronic disease before they came to Jordan.   However, when they arrived, they began asking about the location of centers offering medical and health services.   They asked the neighbors and acquaintances in the area where they live.   Some discovered that the location of these services is far away from their homes and had to go by a private car at their own expense and pay a lot for transportation.   Some had centers close to their homes, but preferred to go with someone to guide them to the location.    The participants mentioned that they drink bottled water, look for accommodation in a well-ventilated house to avoid mold, pay attention to the quality of the food they consume, and refrain from eating canned and ready-made food, all in order to maintain their health and the health of their families.   They also do this so they don’t need to go to the doctor.   They said that they seek treatment at a private clinic where they can run all necessary tests.   However, they have to pay for all that despite the fact that they do not always have the funds to do so.  One participant stated that she walks daily and drinks green tea, not for self-care, but to calm herself.  Another participant mentioned, as all other participants in the session agreed with her, that she knows the importance of eating fruit, especially apples, in the morning, but they cannot keep on doing this, because they cannot purchase apples regularly.  One participant confirmed that her family always rely on the use of painkillers in the event of a headache or any other sort of pain, and do not go to the doctor unless their health deteriorated.   They used to go to the pharmacy and purchase painkillers.   They stressed that doctors show no interest in the patient's health condition, unless the service center is not free.  All participants confirmed that they receive healthcare information by attending health awareness and education sessions, and that they do not trust online information except in rare cases when information is confirmed by a friend or family member.  The relaxation behavior followed by most of the participants is sitting alone in a dark place and listening to music, crying, or speaking to a Facebook friend and not a friend in reality.  The participants stressed that there is no free health service center makes them feel safe. Instead, they prefer to go to a nearby or trusted pharmacist.  They always help family members and friends in any medical condition by taking them to this trusted pharmacist.  While comparing services in the private and the public sector, it was clear that the services of the private sector are the best.   One woman cited a popular proverb, which translates to “If it’s free, it’s worthless!”  Another said: “If you have money, then you are a Pasha “Sir””.  Bad diagnoses and mismanagement were reported at health centers as well as over-crowding (too many patients), malpractices, long waiting times, and having to wait for free service hoping that they would turn out to be good.  They depend on the information provided by others to help them. They also go to any place they hear about to get the service and make sure it is actually existent.  Experience and evaluation of health care delivery locations vary depending on the location. Details will be listed in the table below to avoid repetition.  In general, the poor waiting experience in some places has been a source of complain, especially with the existence of children.   Access to the health care centers is challenging if they are remote or in an area not well-served by public transportation, as users tend to avoid being exploited by taxi drivers.    I woke up at 5:30 am to book to get in line early after some friends recommended I do so.  It was very tiring.   The doctor only gave me painkillers.  He asked me to undergo tomography, but I cannot cover the cost of that.      Waiting in line at the Emirati Hospital after waking up very early.   She was transferred to the governmental, then to Zarqa Governmental Hospital.   She was admitted to the hospital after long procedures and paperwork, then she underwent an appendectomy.      Zarqa hospital admitted them after paying a small sum.   Then after 5 hours of waiting for approvals.   He received treatment for 9 days.   He underwent a gastroscopy, because of the severe internal bleeding in the stomach.   The suffering and pain lasted for 2 months before they discovered that he is suffering from renal failure and requires dialysis.    If there is an organization that helps us by providing health care services, we ask ourselves: Will there be a queue? Is there a full insurance? Will my journey to the location be a waste of time? Will I be treated badly?  Some people get full medication attention and get treated well, while others do not enjoy this advantage?  We, as refugees, suffer from the effects of nepotism and favoritism.    I always stand in line, but my children have the experience and intelligence to find what is appropriate for me so I do not wait long, Doctors treat me just fine, and the treatment itself is excellent.   I hope all organizations treat people that way I am treated.      After arriving at the center, they enter and endure bad reception.   They stand in line to register their names, and then go to accounting to pay for the diagnosis.   Afterwards, they wait until their turn comes and then wait in hours and after all this trouble, they see the doctor, who without any examinations, talks to them and provides the diagnosis.   He then asks them to go to the hospital and transfers them to the private clinics.   After that, they don’t receive any treatment or the medication is not prescribed to them, and even if they were given a prescription, the medication is not available in the center, and they have to buy it from private pharmacies outside the governmental center.   They pointed out that they have already paid a minimum of 4 JDs for the doctor, at this point so they deserve to be examined and given treatment.   They have had suffered a lot because of the lack of care displayed at these centers.   Officials deal with them as mere papers and IDs. The participants have also disclosed that they do not have IDs or health insurance.   They wish they could find a place with adequate health services, since they pay a lot only to receive treatment.   Some of them go to pharmacies to buy medicine.   They explain the symptoms to the pharmacist who then prescribes medications based on their description of the symptoms.     One participant reported that she had to take her sick child to a center that provides free services.   The girl did not get a good treatment, examination, or medication, and thus did not get better.  She took the child to a well-known pharmacist in the area where she lives who diagnosed the condition and gave her a different drug.   The child’s health improved because of this new drug, which deepened the family’s trust in this pharmacist.  The pharmacist was kind and sympathetic and showed compassion with the child’s condition.  The attempt to obtain health care during the visits was mentioned more than once, but the service was not up to par for various reasons, such as the fact that some cases are not covered or lack of treatment.  The length of the procedures in government hospitals was also discussed, in addition to fatigue and the burden of transportation.  The lack of medications at health care centers forces the users sometimes to personally cover the expenses.  In some cases, lack of free medication was a major problem, which sometimes forced users to overlook the disease and not take any medications.  In some cases, doctors showed distinctive treatment. Some would follow the patient's condition after some time and ensure his/her safety. When she mentioned this incident, I felt that it had touched her and gave her a sense of importance and appreciation.    Could not afford the treatment/medication.    Treatment is complete.    He undergoes dialysis twice a week in Amman. Expenses are fully covered by Sams, because Jordan Health Aid Society does not cover them. Often they receive free medication.   The treatment and the transportation to Amman is causing physical and psychological exhaustion, not to mention that the cost of transportation for every dialysis session is 35 JDs.   They later discovered that he has low platelets levels and requires blood transfusion.      Some people have experienced the feeling of comfort and justice, while others discovered that going to an organization or center that provide free care is a bad idea, so they decided to resort to centers or clinics and defray the services themselves.   They think this is much better than standing in a long queue or being told that there are no doctors.    It was clear that they have go through a lot of trouble to receive health care, and they are suffering because of their health, psychological, and financial status.   Some of them did not complete their treatment, because of their inability to cover the costs of treatment.   Some had to sell their furniture to fund the treatment, some borrowed money, and some of them admit the patient under false information in order to save his/her life.   I cannot describe how frustration they are at government centers and the places where the health services are located, because they have suffered a lot and they don’t trust them anymore.    One of the participants shared a story: She went to a health center that provides free medical services where she was examined but did not get the medication.   Instead, the doctor wrote her a prescription to buy the medications herself from outside the center.   This happened after she waited a long time to be seen by the doctor, and travelled a long distance in public transportation.   Now, she has to go and buy the very expensive medicine, which she cannot afford.   So she returned home in a state of severe depression.  The burdens of transportation was mentioned.   Some even said that they move from one place to another to another to reduce the cost of treatment and shorten the waiting time for services in nearby centers.   It may take months to get an appointment at some centers.  One woman spoke of a humanitarian service she received from a Chief Practitioner.   She encountered a problem and he treated her humanely, neglecting the routine procedures and treating her daughter.   She summed it up by saying that the service depends on the doctor.  If only, there is a treatment center for burns and cosmetic treatment.  If only, there is treatment and coverage for the cost of delivery and childbirth.  It was mentioned that lack of money is the biggest obstacle to receiving good services in addition to the exploitation and high cost of transportation.  I wish there was full coverage of the costs of medications, and at least partial coverage of the costs of operations.  I wish there was Health care can be provided to children and for emergency conditions.  I wish there were healthcare locations in vital areas with easy and accessible transportations.      All the processes she took are correct, but she was deluded to think she can get some financial support, so all of her observations were about not getting any financial support.   She did not provide me with the full stages that she went through during the treatment.   She only mentioned and simple mechanisms that other members of the groups already mentioned.      She had very sad eyes while telling the story.   She even burst into tears.   She believes justice is more important than financial support.   She and her brother requires psychological support.      Yes, some cases have no stages (before - after - during), because they are urgent and constitute an emergency (no warning).  So it is a very difficult experience, starting with finding the right place for treatment, securing the money in a hurry, to dealing with the problem of no doctors in a certain shift.    A 45 years old Syrian women told me her experience.   Her grandson, who is 1.5 years old and Syrian, suffers from a severe and chronic asthma.   They went to the government hospital in Zatari camp, but the doctor refused to treat the child and told her that he has no UNHCR ID card or any identification papers to prove his nationality.   The child's condition was very deplorable and critical, but the doctor ignored her pleas. Instead, he told her to go to Rahma Hospital.   Indeed, she went to Rahma Hospital and had to cover the cost of transportation.   She thought the new hospital would treat her just like the one in the camp.   So she decided to admit the child under the name of her 3-year-old daughter, despite the risks associated with admitting him as a younger female.   When they arrived, she was asked to pay 50 JDs as insurance.   After the child was treated, she was presented with a 130 JDs bill, which she could not afford.   They spent about 8 consecutive days in the hospital.   It was very difficult for this woman and her child, who was held hostage for three days until the hospital account was paid.   The hospital treated her and her child as an account not urgent human cases.   She endured a lot, but still looks for someone to help her cover the cost of treatment for her and her children.   There are five cases in the house that requires medical attention.     Also, she suffers from blood clots under the skin and body, in addition to diabetes and hypertension.   She said she does not want anything, no money or anything, besides a safe place that meets her medical needs.  I thanked her for providing me with information, and she thanked me for listening to her before entrusting me to deliver her voice and story to the officials and those who can create change.     I had a meeting with 3 young, married women, the oldest of which is 42 years old.   We talked about how to access and obtain health care services and how each of them decided to go to the doctor.   They responded by stating that after a great deal of pain, disease, and developing symptoms, they finally decided to seek treatment at private centers or clinics.   All of the women have had difficulty accessing to health services because of transportation and its cost.   After they went to receive treatment and were examined, some were suffering from severe calcareous shortage, others had hormonal, vaginal infections (which tests were very costly), slip disks, back and joint pain, etc.   One woman in particular was suffering from bleeding due to pregnancy and her situation was very serious.   All of the women agreed that the services they received did not meet all their needs, and that they had to pay large amounts of money in exchange of these services.   It was clear that they were fatigued, showing clear signs of frustration due to their poor health.   One of the women visited the Emirati hospital in Mafraq to receive treatment, but regretted her decision because she had difficulty in accessing and obtaining the health services there.   She also had to wait for over 6 hours in a queue.   All of the participants wish to deliver their voices to the officials who can help alleviate their suffering.   They also confirmed that the only thing they want is medical treatment and medicine that is accessible to everyone.   I thanked them for all the information they provided, and when I asked questions about NGOs and IRC, they thanked me for caring and listening to them.   They also thanked IRC for taking the time to listen to their problems.   Finally, I concluded the meeting by thanking them and wishing them all the best.   They show clear interest in the health of their children.   They want to receive the best care, and they possess some knowledge and information that are useful when dealing with emergency cases.    The need to access basic health services is a major obstacle for our Syrian brothers and sisters.   Financial support does not cover 70% of full treatment, as reported by most health care organizations.   So the risks to them are great.   Organizations need to work together closely, because I believe the main reason Syrians left their country was not bullets or bombs like most other people, but the fear that they could not receive the periodic medical treatment they need to survive.    All of the interviewees have the same problem, but in different ways.   They cannot find treatment, and there is no one who can cover the expenses of their treatment.   No organization can afford to fully cover the cost of their treatment. All of the interviewees are forced to pay a lot of money to receive health care services.   Some go to organizations believing that they will find treatment, but they find nothing and have to endure the cost of transportation.   Some go to organizations and discover that they had the wrong address.   They all regret going to organizations and government centers, because they do not receive services there.   On the contrary, they feel humiliated and treated as papers and IDs.   What did they do to deserve this?   They are people like us and one of the simplest rights they deserve is medical treatment for them and their children.   The only thing they can do is pray to God to relieve their suffering.   They endure unspeakable hardship.   When I asked them about the organizations, and the difference between IRC and other organizations.   Some said that they never heard of IRC.   Others said that IRC appoints people who do not do their jobs well and treat people badly.   They also said that the employees are Syrian who only help their relatives.   They wish IRC would take care of this problem, because it distorts IRC’s image.   Others wish IRC would open a department to provide healthcare services, respond to all their health needs, and cover the expenses and the cost of treatment and emergency operations for them and their children.   I, Hanan Abdel Rahim Al-Zu'bi, wish the same, because I am one of them and I suffer like them.    After the session, I noticed that most people have a very negative impression formed around the treatment provided at the free health service centers.   They believe these services are useless and hard to access.   Most refugees resort to good healthy habits that reduce their risk of disease, and when they have a simple illness or health condition, they resort to painkillers or alternative natural treatments.   They only go to the doctor when their health severely deteriorates, and even then, they prefer to go to a private doctor and pay for the service although it constitutes a burden.   They simply do this because they are convinced of the inefficiency of free service centers.  People were very interested in attending awareness and health education lectures, as they consider them to be a source of learning that could help them avoid diseases.
