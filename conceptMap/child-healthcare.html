<h1>Child Healthcare</h1></br>

<p class='description'>Description: Child healthcare was a particular concern from the focus group participants.  To lower costs, many families used free clinics as a main healthcare provider.  However, long waits and transportation was often very difficult when children were involved.  Free clinics were the lower cost option but families were concerned about their quality, long waits, and transportation costs.</br>
