<h1>Cost: Healthcare Hurdle</h1></br>


<p class='description'>Description: Costs and poor economic situations were seen by the participants as a major obstacle to quality healthcare.</br></br>

Comments:  </br> 
<span><ul><li>'Poor economic situation is the biggest challenge faced by families.'</li></br>
<li>'Cost is a major obstacle to receiving excellent service in the private sector.'</li></br>
<li>'Poor financial conditions are a major obstacle to receiving better service and securing treatment.'</li></br>
<li>'It was mentioned that lack of money is the biggest obstacle to receiving good services.'</li></br>
<li>'All of the interviewees have the same problem, but in different ways. They cannot find treatment, and there is no one who can cover the expenses of their treatment. No organization can afford to fully cover the cost of their treatment. All of the interviewees are forced to pay a lot of money to receive health care services.'</li></br>
<li>'If there is an organization that helps us by providing health care services, we ask ourselves:  Is there a full insurance?'</li></br>
<li>'Some had to sell their furniture to fund the treatment, some borrowed money, and some of them admit the patient under false information in order to save his/her life.'</li></span></p>
