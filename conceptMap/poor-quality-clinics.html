<h1>Poor Quality at Free Clinics</h1></br>	

<p class='description'>Description: Many focus group participants had complaints about the poor quality of service at the 'free' clinics.</br> 
</br>
Comments:  </br> 
<span><ul><li>'Complaints focused on the ineffectiveness of (free) health services.'</li></br>
<li>'Complaints of poor diagnoses by the health providers.'</li></br>
<li>'Lack of treatment from free health services.'</li></br>
<li>'Focus on the weakness of free health services and inaccurate diagnosis.'</li></br>
<li>'Bad diagnoses and mismanagement were reported at free health centers.'</li></br>
<li>'Over-crowding (too many patients) were reported at free centers as well.'</li></br>
<li>'Long waiting times and having to wait for free service hoping that they would turn out to be good.'</li></br>
<li>'The doctor only gave me painkillers'</br>'At Zarqa, he underwent a gastroscopy, because of the severe internal bleeding in the stomach. The suffering and pain lasted for 2 months before they discovered that he is suffering from renal failure and requires dialysis.'</li></br>
<li>'If only, there is a treatment center for burns and cosmetic treatment.'</br>
<li>'If there is an organization that helps us by providing health care services, we ask ourselves: Will I be treated badly?'</li></br>
<li>'They wish they could find a place with adequate health services, since they pay a lot only to receive treatment.'</li></br>
<li>'They pointed out that they have already paid a minimum of 4 JDs for the doctor, at this point so they deserve to be examined and given treatment. They have had suffered a lot because of the lack of care displayed at these centers. Officials deal with them as mere papers and IDs.'</li></br>
<li>'One participant reported that she had to take her sick child to a center that provides free services. The girl did not get a good treatment, examination, or medication, and thus did not get better.'</li></br>
<li>'All of the women agreed that the services they received did not meet all their needs, and that they had to pay large amounts of money in exchange of these services.'</li></span></p>
