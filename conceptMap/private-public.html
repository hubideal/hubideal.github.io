<h1>Private Over Public</h1></br>
<p class='description'>Description: Most of the participants from the focus group expressed their preference to go to private clinics over free clinics, however costs were a major obstacle.  The free clinics were perceived as lower quality.</br> 
</br>
Comments:  </br> <span><ul><li>'We receive the services from the Emirati hospital and other places.'</li></br>
<li>'They suffer from long waiting times because of the pressure on the Emirati Hospital.'</li></br>
<li>'The group agreed that the Emirati Hospital provides good service.'</li></br>
<li>'They prefer going to a private doctor and bearing the costs of treatment, thus saving time, effort, and travel costs.'</li></br>
<li>'After the pain persisted for 3 months, she decided to visit the Emirati Hospital.'</li></br>
<li>'They did an ECHO scan at the Emirati Hospital.'</li></br>
<li>'While comparing services in the private and the public sector, it was clear that the services of the private sector are the best.'</li></br>
<li>'One woman cited a popular proverb, which translates to 'If it’s free, it’s worthless!'</li></br>
<li>'Another said: “If you have money, then you are a Pasha ‘Sir’”.'</li></br>
<li>'Informal care, private clinic, pharmacies.'</li></br>
<li>'If we have difficulty dealing with the health situation, we have to go to private and expensive clinics.'</li></br>
<li>'They said that they seek treatment at a private clinic where they can run all necessary tests. However, they have to pay for all that despite the fact that they do not always have the funds to do so.'</li></br>
<li>'Some people have experienced the feeling of comfort and justice, while others discovered that going to an organization or center that provide free care is a bad idea, so they decided to resort to centers or clinics and defray the services themselves.'</li></br>
<li>'We talked about how to access and obtain health care services and how each of them decided to go to the doctor. They responded by stating that after a great deal of pain, disease, and developing symptoms, they finally decided to seek treatment at private centers or clinics.'</li></br>
<li>'They all regret going to organizations and government centers, because they do not receive services there.'</li></br>
<li>'After the session, I noticed that most people have a very negative impression formed around the treatment provided at the free health service centers. They believe these services are useless and hard to access.'</li></br>
<li>'They prefer to go to a private doctor and pay for the service although it constitutes a burden. They simply do this because they are convinced of the inefficiency of free service centers.'</li></span></p>
