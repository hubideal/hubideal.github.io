<h1>Word of Mouth</h1></br>	
<p class='description'>Description: Many refugees discussed the importance of word of mouth as an important communication tool in navigating the healthcare system.  They ususally did not trust websites and were concerned of health centers closing.  Therefore they often relied on friends and family members to find healthcare centers. </br> 
</br>
Comments:  </br> <span><ul><li>'If there is an organization that helps us by providing health care services, we ask ourselves : Will my journey to the location be a waste of time?'</li></br>
<li>'They think this is much better to go to a private clinic than standing in a long queue or being told that there are no doctors.'</li></br>
<li>'When they decided to go to government centers or private clinics, some of the women were showing symptoms, like headache, dizziness, general weakness, and other symptoms of multiple communicable and non-communicable diseases. Some of them had a chronic disease before they came to Jordan. However, when they arrived, they began asking about the location of centers offering medical and health services. They asked the neighbors and acquaintances in the area where they live. Some discovered that the location of these services is far away from their homes and had to go by a private car at their own expense and pay a lot for transportation. Some had centers close to their homes, but preferred to go with someone to guide them to the location.'</li></br>
<li>'They depend on asking relatives and friends and the experience of others in knowing centers and services.'</li></br>
<li>'Depending on people networks for information.'</li></br><li>'She inquired, and through friends and acquaintances, was able to find healtcare services.'</li></br>
<li>'They also go to any place they hear about to get the service and make sure it is actually existent.'</li></br>
<li>'They depend on the information provided by others to help them'</li></br>
<li>'That they do not trust online information except in rare cases when information is confirmed by a friend or family member.'</li></span></p>
