<h1>Lack of Transparency</h1></br>	


<p class='description'>Description: Many participants from the focus groups expressed concern about favoritism, nepotism, and lack of transparency at the free clinics.</br> 
</br>
Comments:  </br> <span><ul><li>'Refugees were pessimistic that oversees funding was going directly to healthcare'</li></br>
<li>'Refugees expressed frustration about the lack of tranparency'</br>'Perceptions of nepotism and favoritism.'</li></br>
<li>'Some people get full medication attention and get treated well, while others do not enjoy this advantage?  We, as refugees, suffer from the effects of nepotism and favoritism.'</li></br>
<li>'When I asked them about the organizations, and the difference between IRC and other organizations. Some said that they never heard of IRC. Others said that IRC appoints people who do not do their jobs well and treat people badly. They also said that the employees are Syrian who only help their relatives. They wish IRC would take care of this problem, because it distorts IRC’s image. Others wish IRC would open a department to provide healthcare services, respond to all their health needs, and cover the expenses and the cost of treatment and emergency operations for them and their children.'</li></br>
<li>'Financial exploitation (transportation/taxi).'</br>
<li>'We need medical security, because we are afraid aid might be cut off just like the case with Jordan Health Aid Society.'</li></br>
<li>'Lack of credibility in dealing with healthcare clinics.'</li></br>
<li>'I cannot describe how frustration they are at government centers and the places where the health services are located, because they have suffered a lot and they don’t trust them anymore.'</li></span></p>
